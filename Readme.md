Vision thread is a helper library for Qt based computer vision applications.

Vision thread implements video input, processing and computer vision tasks in a separate thread from Qt GUI, while
keeping the code for creation the vision subsystem and communication with it as simple and straightforward as possible.

# History

## The first attempt

A single VideoThread object runs a separate thread which polls video input for frames, wraps frame data into
QImage and makes it available (for processing and display) via a Qt signal. The idea is that processing objects will be
created inside the video thread and use direct signal->slot connections, while main thread (and possibly other threads,
e.g. robot hardware control threads) will use queued signal->slot connections.

This works, but care must be taken to use queued connections between vision / GUI threads. Automatic connections don't
work because VideoThread itself "lives" (in strict Qt sense) in the main thread.

A better, safer solution with simpler external API would have video objects (input/processing) separated from the
thread object and living in the vision thread in some more obvious way. Something along the lines of the sugestions
form [this thread](http://lists.trolltech.com/qt-interest/2007-09/thread00073-0.html)

## The second attempt

VideoCapture object moves itself to a different thread upon construction. The thread itself is supplied by the client
code. All connections between the GUI objects and VideoCapture can be automatic.

Another helper object - ThreadWaiter - quits registered threads when the application is about to quit and waits for
them to finish.

The main() looks like a bit of a highly coupled boilerplate mess though.

## Refinement of a ThreadWaiter

Thread waiter may now be asked to produce a registered thread, which makes code a bit cleaner.

## Reusing useful GUI functionality

While it's up to the application what to do with the incoming video frames, the device controls will most probably
be always pretty much the same. At the moment large portion of main() is taken up by connecting VideoCapture to the
widgets (which are manually added to the GUI in the designer). It would have been much better, if the widgets were
provided by a reusable widget, aware of the VideoCapture API.

Actually, we went further and hid the VideoCapture (together with its thread and ThreadWaiter) in VideoCaptureControls.

## Persistence

The client code may ask the VideoCaptureControls to persist in QSettings instance.

## Processing

There will be two sorts of processing - in video thread and outside. Outside is already demonstrated by the display -
just connecting a slot to the gotFrame(QImage) is enough. To place a processor inside video thread it is enough to make
it a child of the VideoCapture object (returned by VideoCaptureControls::capture()).
